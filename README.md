# Commit Test

### 5. Perform an initial sync

When syncing for the first time, you’ll have the option to sync in one of two directions:

1. Git<mark style="color:red;">**Book**</mark> -> Git**Hub** will sync your space’s content **to** the selected branch. This is great if you’re starting from an empty repository and want to get your GitBook content in quickly.
2. Git**Hub** -> Git<mark style="color:red;">**Book**</mark> will sync your space’s content **from** the selected branch. This is great if you have existing Markdown content in a repository and want to bring it into GitBook.
